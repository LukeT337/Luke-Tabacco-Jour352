                            The trailblazer’s story symbolizes the pain and resilience of America. Can the reality
                            outlast the myth?

                        Rachel Robinson couldn’t give her blessing at first. She told the sculptor: “I’m sorry. I’m not
                        seeing him.” At that point, it had been nearly 50 years since her husband, Jackie Robinson, died
                        and more than 70 since he broke baseball’s color barrier. But an eternal love can see through
                        time. The statue wasn’t right.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rachel relayed an idea through her daughter, Sharon.</p>
                    <p>“I’d like to see more of a smile,” she requested.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the sculptor’s revised work, Jackie flashed a warm smile. He looked relaxed. Posing with a
                        bat over his right shoulder and his left hand on his hip, he looked stately but accessible.
                        Robinson, a seminal figure whose grace and tenacity expedited the racial integration of a
                        shambling nation, stood with purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>“That’s my Jack,” his widow said.</p>
                    <p>
                        In 2021, the statue was unveiled in Wichita, in front of the home complex of local youth
                        baseball association League 42. In no time, it became a local treasure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three years later, on a wet and gray January day, the city awoke to a disturbing sight. The
                        statue had vanished overnight, severed at the ankles, leaving only two bronze cleats atop home
                        plate.

                        Jack Roosevelt Robinson didn’t believe in his own myth. Too many sports legends are perfectly
                        crafted to make athletics seem like utopia. They’re not, but the caretaking of this fantasy
                        enables a kind of indifference that poisons the pursuit of greater progress. Nostalgia further
                        complicates matters, leading some to trust that the bad stuff was handled long ago and any
                        current problems are exaggerated because society has advanced. But better can be better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Somehow, that notion is divisive now. A zero-sum mentality creates controversy out of inclusion,
                        corrupting the memory of Robinson and every other sporting pioneer who changed the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The progress we’ve made is neither adequate nor permanent. Robinson had an acute understanding
                        of the struggle. He was the son of sharecroppers, born on the James Madison Sasser plantation
                        near Cairo, Ga. His grandparents were enslaved. Yet 28 years into his life, he ended six decades
                        of racial segregation in baseball on April 15, 1947.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, we sanitize the moment and reference it mostly as compelling evidence of diminishing
                        racism. It is seen as a conclusion. To Robinson, it was merely one inning in the longest game
                        ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Baseball wasn’t the end goal of Jackie Robinson’s work,” said David Robinson, the youngest of
                        his three children. “It wasn’t what he was trying to achieve. That’s a misunderstanding, and
                        sometimes that’s projected too much. Baseball was part of his struggle to create opportunity for
                        America.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “When he got his opportunity, there was no complacency. He showed what we could do, showed
                        America what it could be. He did not want success to blind us because he knew that, literally,
                        our survival is not guaranteed.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How we remember Robinson says much about how we view America. It symbolizes our cruelty and our
                        glory, our pain and our resilience. It’s the most important tale in our sports history, a
                        breakthrough of incalculable moral, cultural and financial proportions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the years, we have taken good care of the Robinson dream and ignored much of the reality.
                        With his transformative vision, Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey chose Robinson as
                        a “noble experiment” to integrate baseball because he recognized his combination of talent and
                        temperament. Robinson could overcome the racist taunts and vicious acts. He had learned to
                        suppress his emotions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But he was not some docile Black athlete grateful just to be tolerated. He was strong. On the
                        field, he kept his cool. Off the field, he became a face and a voice of radical change. The Rev.
                        Martin Luther King Jr. captured Robinson well, praising him as a “pilgrim” for the civil rights
                        movement and saying of his lonely, courageous, dignified journey: “He was a sit-inner before the
                        sit-ins, a freedom rider before the freedom rides.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every April, Jackie Robinson Day is celebrated throughout baseball, the signature event of the
                        first month of a new season. MLB retired his number in 1997, and on his special day, every major
                        leaguer wears No. 42. But Robinson wouldn’t care to be another symbol of the embellished good of
                        sport. He was a determined humanitarian, and much of the equality he fought for has yet to be
                        realized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We make him into our injustice elixir. One annual dose, and everything becomes fair and
                        righteous. It is akin to politicians who trot out King’s tamest quotes on MLK Day, taking a
                        short break from furtively disenfranchising voters. They use the concepts of equality and unity
                        as a generic salve rather than a mission to break systemic patterns that fortify
                        marginalization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Robinson spent the final act of his life rejecting such deception. Before he died at 53 after a
                        heart attack, he wrote his 1972 autobiography, “I Never Had It Made.” It’s more about his fight
                        for justice than baseball. In it, he went back a quarter-century and, with fresh eyes, retold
                        the story of playing in his first World Series. His words are unsparingly painful and prescient
                        for the modern protesting athlete.

                        He wrote: “There I was the black grandson of a slave, the son of a black sharecropper, part of a
                        historic occasion, a symbolic hero to my people. The air was sparkling. The sunlight was warm.
                        The band struck up the national anthem. The flag billowed in the wind. It should have been a
                        glorious moment for me as the stirring words of the national anthem poured from the stands.
                        Perhaps it was, but then again perhaps the anthem could be called the theme song for a drama
                        called The Noble Experiment. Today as I look back on that opening game of my first world series,
                        I must tell you that it was Mr. Rickey’s drama and that I was only a principal actor. As I write
                        this twenty years later, I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know
                        that I am a black man in a white world. In 1972, in 1947, at my birth in 1919, I know that I
                        never had it made.”

                        David was just 4 years old when his father retired from baseball. He has learned plenty about
                        his career, as well as his four-sport college exploits at UCLA. But he remembers the activist,
                        the man who never declared victory after integrating baseball. He remembers family dinners with
                        prominent Black leaders and heartbreaking conversations after incidents of racial violence. He
                        remembers domestic marches and international travel. Jackie and Rachel Robinson gave their
                        children a global view, and all those experiences intersected at one theme: participation. Don’t
                        disengage and watch from the bleachers. Live to serve.

                        “Involvement was mandatory,” David said during a recent phone call from his home in Tanzania.
                        “It has been a wonderful lifetime of commitment.”

                        In East Africa, David and his family are coffee farmers. He chose the profession as part of an
                        effort to help integrate African resources into the American and global economy. In 1989, he
                        started clearing a forest area in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania to establish a base and
                        join a cooperative of third-generation Tanzanian coffee farmers.
