        <h2>Experience</h2>
        
        <h3>Retail Store Sales Associate</h3>
        <h4>Goat USA - Danbury, CT</h4>
        <h5>June, 2025 - Present</h5>
        <p>I worked at Goat USA while I was home for the summer! I started when the store was
completely empty and helped build it into what it became today! After working there
all summer and performing well, when I go back after the semester I am getting a
promotion from a retail associate to a sales lead!</p>
        
        <h3>Crew Member</h3>
        <h4>Jersey Mike’s Subs - Brookfield, CT</h4>
        <h5>April, 2021 - February, 2023</h5>
        <p>This was my first job! I started working here when I was 16 years old. I learned
how to manage inventory, work as a team and how to handle large crowds with
exceptional customer service.</p>
        
        <h3>Car Detailer and Washer</h3>
        <h4>Honda of Danbury - Danbury, CT</h4>
        <h5>February, 2023 - May, 2025</h5>
        <p>I started working here when I turned 18. A job I could manage while I was home for
summer breaks as a college student. I learned how to work quickly and efficiently,
as well as continuing my strength to work well as a team.</p>
        
        <h3>Beat Writer</h3>
        <h4>WMUC Sports</h4>
        <h5>February, 2025 - Present</h5>
        <p>I worked as the University of Maryland Men’s Lacrosse beat writer for WMUC Sports!
This was one of the greatest experiences in my life as I got to cover every home
game in person from the press box, as well as having the opportunity to appear and
interview in all the post game press conferences.</p>
        
        <h3>Sports Gamer Reporter and Editor</h3>
        <h4>Terrapin Sports Central</h4>
        <h5>August, 2023 - Present</h5>
        <p>I started working for studio production for the weekly shows when I first started
as a freshman! I’ve now grown to being able to report and edit gamers for various
University of Maryland sports including men and women’s lacrosse, volleyball,
baseball, as well as men’s soccer this upcoming season.</p>
